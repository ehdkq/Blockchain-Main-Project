# Weekly Progress Report: Week 8

This report details the progress made from the foundational work in Week 7 to the more complex, project-specific implementation in Week 8 for the agricultural DApp.

### What have you done?

This week, we transitioned from a basic proof-of-concept contract to the core smart contract for the agricultural platform and established a robust testing environment.

* **Developed the Core Smart Contract (`AgriSensorData.sol`):** We replaced the preliminary `Voting.sol` contract with `AgriSensorData.sol`, the main contract for the project. This new contract includes:
    * **Role-Based Access Control:** Implemented distinct roles like `DEVICE_ROLE`, `FARMER_ROLE`, and `SUPPLY_CHAIN_ROLE` to manage permissions for different users.
    * **Complex Data Structures:** Defined `structs` to handle `SensorReading`, `CropEvent`, and `SupplyChainStage` data, making the contract capable of storing detailed agricultural information.
    * **Advanced Functions:** Created functions for submitting single and batch sensor readings (`submitSensorData`, `submitBatch`) and for recording key agricultural events (`recordCropEvent`, `recordSupplyChainStage`).
    * **Data Integrity and Anomaly Detection:** Added logic to prevent duplicate data submissions using hashes and to emit events for anomalous sensor readings.

* **Migrated to a Foundry Testing Environment:** We moved from a Hardhat/TypeScript testing setup (used for `Voting.ts` and `Counter.ts`) to a more powerful Foundry environment.
    * **Comprehensive Test Suite:** Wrote an extensive test contract (`AgriSensorData.t.sol`) in Solidity to validate the new contract's functionality.
    * **In-Depth Test Scenarios:** The new tests cover positive and negative paths, role-based access restrictions, batch submission logic, event emissions, and anomaly detection triggers, ensuring the contract is reliable.

### Challenges we faced

* **Architectural Complexity:** Designing the `AgriSensorData` contract required significant planning to ensure the data structures were efficient and the access control logic was secure for different types of users (farmers, IoT devices, etc.).
* **Transitioning Testing Frameworks:** Moving from Hardhat/Chai tests written in TypeScript to Foundry tests written in Solidity involved a learning curve. We had to adapt to a new workflow and utilize Foundry's cheatcodes (`vm.prank`, `vm.expectEmit`) to effectively simulate complex interactions and state changes.
* **Ensuring Data Integrity:** A key challenge was designing a mechanism to prevent duplicate sensor readings, especially in batch submissions. This was solved by creating and storing a unique hash for each data entry and reverting transactions with duplicate hashes.

### What will you do?

With a well-tested core contract now complete, the focus for next week will be on deployment and frontend integration.

* **Update Deployment Scripts:** Modify the Hardhat deployment script (`deploy.ts`) to deploy the new `AgriSensorData.sol` contract to the `didlab` network, replacing the script for the old `Voting` contract.
* **Integrate Contract with DApp:** Connect the DApp frontend to the newly deployed `AgriSensorData` contract. This will involve updating the contract address and ABI in the frontend and building UI components that call the contract's functions (`submitSensorData`, `getReadingsByFarm`, etc.).
* **Refine User Interface for Roles:** Enhance the DApp's UI to cater to the different user roles defined in the contract. For example, create a specific view for farmers to record crop events and another for supply chain partners to log transportation stages.
* **Finalize Documentation:** Update the `README.md` files for both the contract and the DApp with the final deployed contract address, detailed usage instructions, and screenshots of the functional application on the `didlab` network.
