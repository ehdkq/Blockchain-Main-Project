# Supply Chain  — Blockchain Track (Hardhat)

## Overview
This project is part of our semester-long milestone submissions (Weeks 6–14).  
We are building a Blockchain-Backed IoT Data Verification System for Smart Farming using **Hardhat**, **GitHub **, and **Tailscale** for secure collaboration.  

The system will include:
- Smart contracts written in Solidity for core banking operations.
- A secure backend integrated with Ethereum local testnets.
- CI workflows for automated testing and builds.
- Project planning, weekly updates, and documentation.
