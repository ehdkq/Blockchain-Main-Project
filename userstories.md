# 1. **Farmer – Crop Monitoring & Trustworthy Data**
- **As a** farmer, **I want to** monitor real-time soil and weather data from IoT sensors, **so that** I can make informed decisions about irrigation and fertilization.  
- **As a** farmer, **I want to** store environmental sensor data immutably on the blockchain, **so that** I can verify that the data is accurate and hasn’t been tampered with.  
- **As a** farmer, **I want to** track the full lifecycle of crops (from seeding to harvest) using blockchain-backed records, **so that** I can prove the quality and origin of my produce to buyers.

# 2. **Agricultural Scientist / Researcher – Data Analysis**
- **As a** researcher, **I want to** access historical sensor data stored on the blockchain, **so that** I can analyze environmental trends without worrying about data manipulation.  
- **As a** researcher, **I want to** verify the source and integrity of agricultural data, **so that** my research is based on reliable information.

# 3. **Supply Chain Manager – Traceability**
- **As a** supply chain manager, **I want to** trace the journey of agricultural products from farm to market via blockchain records, **so that** I can ensure transparency and trust for consumers.  
- **As a** supply chain manager, **I want to** get alerts if any IoT sensor data (like temperature during transport) deviates from the norm, **so that** I can take timely action to reduce spoilage.

# 4. **Consumer – Trust in Food Source**
- **As a** consumer, **I want to** scan a QR code on a product and see its blockchain-verified origin, **so that** I can trust its quality and safety.  
- **As a** consumer, **I want to** verify that a product was grown under ethical and sustainable conditions, **so that** I can make informed purchasing decisions.

# 5. **System Administrator – Security and Access Control**
- **As a** DAO, **I want to** manage permissions for IoT devices using on-chain voting or smart contract logic, **so that** only verified devices can submit trusted data.  
- **As a** DAO, **I want to** automatically trigger alerts or actions when smart contracts detect abnormal data patterns, **so that** the network remains secure without centralized oversight.

# 6. **IoT Device (Automated Interaction – Optional)**
- **As an** IoT sensor device, **I want to** automatically send temperature and humidity data every 10 minutes, **so that** farmers receive up-to-date insights.  
- **As an** IoT gateway, **I want to** batch sensor data and commit it to the blockchain every hour, **so that** data is stored efficiently and securely.
